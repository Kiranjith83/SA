# HA and Fault Tolerance.
  - HA:
    - Helps to recover from a failure quickly. 
  
  - Fault Tolerance:
    - Designed to operate throughout a failure with no user impact.

# Disaster recovery
  - RPO 
    - How much a business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup. 
  - RTO 
     - The maximum amount of time a system cab be down. How long a solution takes to recover 
  Other consideration.
  - People.
     Are they on call, do they have necessary access and docs to recover. 

# scaling
  - Choice of scaling method (Vertical/Horizontal) determines the cost and how the scaling is configured. 
  - Appropriately selecting the scaling method determines how you architect the application, cost and what if developers need to incorporate to support their application.

# Tiered Architecture.
  - To be an effective SA, need the understanding of application architecture, then design system architecture for the application. 

# Encryption:
  - Encryption at rest.
    - Symmetric:
      Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. 
      Example:
```
      echo "Cats are Amazing" > hiddenmessage.txt
      gpg -c hiddenmessage.txt
      cat hiddenmessage.txt.gpg
      # Now clear the cached password if you are testing locally.
      echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent
      gpg -o output.txt hiddenmessage.txt.gpg
```
  - Assymetric: 
        It is created by multipart key. 
      Example:
```
  # Generate the key
gpg --gen-key
  # Optionally export the public and private keys. And share Public key with the one whom you are sending the data.
gpg --armor --output pubkey.txt --export 'testkey'
gpg --armor --output privkey.asc --export-secret-keys 'testkey'
  # Encrypt the message.
gpg --encrypt --recipient 'testkey' hiddenmessage.txt
  # Decrypt the message.
gpg --output decrypted.txt --decrypt hiddenmessage.txt.gpg 
```

# Subnetting.

> Current Network:
10.0.0.0/16  -> Split the CIDR 

10.0 > Network  0.0 -> Host range 

> Split to two individual network by incrementing prefix 16

The 1 bit we borrowed is represented in "" ' "". Remember that this is binary, meaning that this borrowed bit can either be 0 or 1. In effect, by borrowing one bit, we can create 2 subnets:

10.0.0.0/16 
Current Subnet 
```
00001010    00000000    00000000    00000000
```
Now to break this into two halfs ()
```
00001010    00000000    0'0000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    1'0000000    00000000
```
10.0.0.0/17
How 17?  -> The total number of CIDRs. 
What are the Networks 

10.0.0.0/17 
10.0.128.0/17 
How 0 and 128 ? As we divided into two halfs then we did 256/2 = 128. SO zero and 128 two equal parts. 


Now to break this into more.
```
00001010    00000000    00'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    10'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    01'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    11'000000    00000000
```
Now this is 4 subnets. 
10.0.0.0/18 
  We could create 4 parts with 0 and 1 combinatiopns. 
  256/4 = 64 . 
  The iprange becomes 
 10.0.0.0/18
 10.0.64.0/18
 10.0.128.0/18
 10.0.192.0/18

or use  ipcalc -b 10.0.0.0/18

 Now to break this into even more.
```
00001010    00000000    000'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    010'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    001'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    100'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    110'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    011'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    111'00000    00000000
```
