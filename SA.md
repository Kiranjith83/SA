# Architecture 101 terms:
  ## Cost efficient or Cost effective architecture. 
   - Implement a solution with AWS Product or product features that provides the require service for as little initial and ongoing costs as possible. 
   - Example, hosting large media files effectively storing on storage solutions. 
   - Picking the right tool for right job. 
  
  ## Secure.
   - Secures data and operations from internal and external attack. 
   - Picking right tool for right job, securely. 
   - Choose the product for the security.

  ## Application Session state. 
   - Application session state is the data that rep what customer is doing. What they choosen, what they selected. 
    - example 1: the shopping card selection details chosen by an user.
    - example 2: Preserving the login details when traffic goes to horizontally scalled application server. 
   - Making sure the application state stored in a single server, or saved externally. 
   - If state is saved in the single server or same server, it is called stateful server
   - If the state is saved externally, its called stateless server. This is more preferred as the application servers can be modified without effecting end user state. 

  ## Undifferentiated heavy lifting. 
   - It means any part of application or system that is not specific to the business. 
     - Example: Describes the part of application that is used by every one, and dont have to focus on. AWS takes care of heavy lifting of the infrastructure management while running your EC2 instances.  
   
# Shared responsibility security model.

# Service models.
 - Iaas
 - Paas
 - Saas
 - Faas

# HA and Fault Tolerance.
  - HA:
    - Helps to recover from a failure quickly. 
  
  - Fault Tolerance:
    - Designed to operate throughout a failure with no user impact.

# Disaster recovery
  - RPO 
    - How much a business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup. 
  - RTO 
     - The maximum amount of time a system cab be down. How long a solution takes to recover 
  Other consideration.
  - People.
     Are they on call, do they have necessary access and docs to recover. 

# scaling
  - Choice of scaling method (Vertical/Horizontal) determines the cost and how the scaling is configured. 
  - Appropriately selecting the scaling method determines how you architect the application, cost and what if developers need to incorporate to support their application.

# Tiered Architecture.
  - To be an effective SA, need the understanding of application architecture, then design system architecture for the application. 

# Encryption:
  - Encryption at rest.
    - Symmetric:
      Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. 
      Example:
```
      echo "Cats are Amazing" > hiddenmessage.txt
      gpg -c hiddenmessage.txt
      cat hiddenmessage.txt.gpg
      # Now clear the cached password if you are testing locally.
      echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent
      gpg -o output.txt hiddenmessage.txt.gpg
```
  - Assymetric: 
        It is created by multipart key. 
      Example:
```
  # Generate the key
gpg --gen-key
  # Optionally export the public and private keys. And share Public key with the one whom you are sending the data.
gpg --armor --output pubkey.txt --export 'testkey'
gpg --armor --output privkey.asc --export-secret-keys 'testkey'
  # Encrypt the message.
gpg --encrypt --recipient 'testkey' hiddenmessage.txt
  # Decrypt the message.
gpg --output decrypted.txt --decrypt hiddenmessage.txt.gpg 
```
  - Encryption in transit
   - Use of TLS

# AWS WAF (Well architect framework)

  The well architect framework tool is available, based on the pillers.
 - WAF introduces principles for each pillers.
  - Automation to build, modify, and evolve the infrastructure.
  - Allows evolutionary architecture using the data. 
  - [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc) 

 WAF Pillers and Design principles.
 - Operation Excellence.
    Focus on the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 
    - Perform operation as a code.
    - Annotate documentation.
    - Make frequent, small reversible changes.
    - Refine operations procedures frequently.
    - Anticipate failures.
    - Learn from all operation failures.
 - Security.
    Includes the ability to protect information systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
    - Implement a strong identity foundation.
    - Enable traceability. 
    - Apply security at all layers.
    - Automate security best practices.
    - Protect data in transit and at rest. 
    - Prepare for security events.
 - Reliability.
    The reliability piller includes the ability of a system to recover from the infra or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and migrate disruptions such as mis configuration or transient network issues.
    - Testing recovery procedures.
    - Automatically recover from failures.
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability.
    - Stop guessing capacity.
    - Manage change in automation.

# Subnetting.

> Current Network:
10.0.0.0/16  -> Split the CIDR 

10.0 > Network  0.0 -> Host range 

> Split to two individual network by incrementing prefix 16

The 1 bit we borrowed is represented in "" ' "". Remember that this is binary, meaning that this borrowed bit can either be 0 or 1. In effect, by borrowing one bit, we can create 2 subnets:

10.0.0.0/16 
Current Subnet 
```
00001010    00000000    00000000    00000000
```
Now to break this into two halfs ()
```
00001010    00000000    0'0000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    1'0000000    00000000
```
10.0.0.0/17
How 17?  -> The total number of CIDRs. 
What are the Networks 

10.0.0.0/17 
10.0.128.0/17 
How 0 and 128 ? As we divided into two halfs then we did 256/2 = 128. SO zero and 128 two equal parts. 


Now to break this into more.
```
00001010    00000000    00'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    10'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    01'000000    00000000
00001010    00000000    11'000000    00000000
```
Now this is 4 subnets. 
10.0.0.0/18 
  We could create 4 parts with 0 and 1 combinatiopns. 
  256/4 = 64 . 
  The iprange becomes 
 10.0.0.0/18
 10.0.64.0/18
 10.0.128.0/18
 10.0.192.0/18

or use  ipcalc -b 10.0.0.0/18

 Now to break this into even more.
```
00001010    00000000    000'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    010'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    001'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    100'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    110'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    011'00000    00000000
00001010    00000000    111'00000    00000000
```
