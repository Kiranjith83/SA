# CI/CD 
- Continuous integration 
    - Compiling code
- Continuous deployment
    - Process of code publish

# CodeCommit

# CodeBuild

# CodePipeline 

# Testing. 
- Why we need testing?
    - It makes sure that:
        - Meet the requirements defined
        - Ensure the code performs in an acceptable period of time.
        - ensure its usable.
        - ensure it responds correctly to all kinds of inputs.
        - Achieves the desired results
- Types of Software testing. 
    - Installation testing. 
    - Compatability testing.
    - Smoke and sanity testing. 
    - Regression testing.
    - Acceptance testing
    - Alpha/Beta testing
    - Functional vs non-functional testing
    - Continuous testing
    - Destructive testing.
    - Software performance testing. 
    - Usability/accessibility testing.
    - AB Testing
    - Sec testing
- Automated test execution can be part of CI/CD process.
    - Unit testing is the way to perform testing in automated way.


# CodeArtifact
- Secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management

# Deployment strategies
## Single target deployment.
    - Deploy to a single target.
## All at once deployment. 
    - Perform deployment to multiple targets 
    - Conducted by orchestration tooling or using any kind of automation.
    - Shares negative of single target as no ability to test, can have deployment outages and les than ideal for rollback.
    - Used for non critical deployment. 
## Minimum in-Service deployment.
    - Keeping min number of instance in service at a time. 
    - Deployment happens in multi stages.
    - No downtime and can do automated testing.
## Rolling deployment. 
    - Deployment happens in stages and only proceed further if the initial deployment is successful.
    - Orchestration and health check is required for this method.
    = Rollback can be performed.
## Blue Green deployment.
    - Blue: Current environment 
    - Green: Perform upgrade by creating the green environment. 
    - A method for swapping the DNS entry with new env is required.
    - Entire method can be automated. 
    - No split of traffic, and the cut over is binary (Either green or blue)
## Canary deployment
    - Both the Blue and Green are kept active and a percentage of traffic is routed in steps to the new env.
    - It can be achieved using Route53 - Weighted round robin traffic policy

# CloudFormation

# Beanstalk

# AWS Config
- AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. 
- Constantly monitors and looks for changes to the AWS Configuration. 
- It can capture the state of configuration at a given point of time.

# AWS Managed Services

# Lambda
- 1 million free req per month. 

# Step Functions.

# OpsWorks

# CloudWatch
- Data points < 60 Sec are available for 3 hours.
- Data points ~= 60 sec (1 min) available for 15 days. 
- Data points ~= 300 sec (5 mins) available for 63 days. 
- Data points ~= 3600 sec (1 hour) available for 445 days (15 months).

## CW Events
- AWS Resources can generate an event when there is a change in its environment.
    - Eg: EC2 instance state changed from Pending to Starting. 
## CW Rules
- Matches the incoming events and routes them to a target for an action.
## CW Targets
- Target process the events. It receives the event in the json format. 
    - Ex: Lambda, Kinesis, SNS and many more.

- Create and distribute application stacks called Products.
- Products can be grouped into folders called Portfolio.

# AWS Trusted Advisor.
- Cost optimization.
- Performance.
- Security.
- Fault tolerance.
- Service Limits.

# AWS Systems Manager.
- Can also use for multi cloud management. 
- On prem instances can be managed with AWS SSM
    - mi-0123456abcdefg (M is the prefix)
- Run command
    - For remote command execution.
- State Manager.
    - Configuration management.
    - Bootstrap instances.

    - Automates the patching.
- Automation.
    - Helps top automate common repetitive tasks. 
- Parameter stores.
    - Centralized location to save configuration data and secrets.
- Session Manager.
    - Secured way to connect to the instance.
    - Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, and virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

# AWS ORganization
- Policy based management for more than one AWS Accounts. 
- SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. They affect only the member accounts in your organization. 

# AWS Secrets Manager.
- Helps to protects secrets used by applications or other services.
- Hardcoded credentials can be replaced with the API call to access the credentials from secret manager.
- Allows automatically rotates the passwords.

- Cert manager to provision, manage and deploy TLS Certificates.

# Incident and Event Management.
# AWS GaurdDuty.
- Threat detection service, monitors AWS Account for malicious and unauthorized access.
- It does this by monitoring :
    - AWS API Calls
    - Unauthorized deployments 
    - Compromized instances. 
- It performs these actions using threat intelligent feeds, cloudwatch events and machine learning.
- To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS resource types: IAM Access Keys, EC2 Instances, and S3 Buckets.
